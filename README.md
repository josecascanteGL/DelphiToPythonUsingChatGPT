# 🧠 Delphi Code Companion

A developer tool that parses Delphi source code from a GitHub repository and generates:

- 🔍 **Annotated Delphi code** with comments and improvement suggestions
- 🐍 **Parsed Python equivalents** of each file (currently literal translations only)

Additionally, it includes a UI for exploring the repository and interacting with the code through a chatbot assistant.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 **Repository Analysis**  
  Clones a GitHub repo and scans its Delphi files (`.pas`, `.dpr`, etc.)

- 💡 **Comment Enrichment**  
  Adds inline comments and proposed refactors to help modernize or improve Delphi code.

- 🐍 **Python Conversion (Basic)**  
  Generates a Python version of each file with a 1-to-1 literal mapping.  
  *(Note: Current version does not yet consider project structure or dependencies.)*

- 🖥️ **Interactive UI**  
  - Browse the cloned repo
  - Load individual files
  - Ask questions or request refactors via a chatbot  
  *(Note: The original source file remains unchanged. Chatbot responses are displayed in a separate panel.)*
